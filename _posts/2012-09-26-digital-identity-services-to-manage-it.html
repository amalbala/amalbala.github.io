<p>I am in a (never-ending) job searching, so in a first round I need to be as attractive as possible ( with my CV, in a professional way, don't misunderstand) for passing the first filter and be able to show myself on a personal interview. I have been looking for a new or better job since long time and I try to increase my chances all the time, I have two primary sources for ideas: people I like to be and clean code. So I want to copy (yes the forbidden word) the CV ideas from others that get nice jobs and I want to reduce the noise, duplicates, redundancy and non useful info and increase the legibility, easy to understand and useful topics. One of my favourites CV comes from <a href="http://www.bernardohernandez.com">Bernardo Hernandez</a> his <a href="http://www.bernardohernandez.com/archivos/pdf/BHResume.pdf">CV</a> is amazing, a top position with one page summarize, nothing left, everything clear and useful.</p>
<p>I get the idea from his website to have an index page for my digital identity, I was searching on <a href="http://www.genbeta.com/">genbeta</a> to get some ideas about, and I discovered <a href="http://about.me/">About.me  </a> It fulfil all my requirements, easy to use, easy to mange, clear and with impact. I had the problem that to include all my current digital identity (twitter, b log, CV, different views of the CV) my CV has so many URLs at the top, and some of them on an unreadable format. So About.me solved two problems: a centralized place to put all my info and a clean interface to decide if you want to continue or not just in a couple of seconds. I really recommend it.</p>
<p>The links included on my <a href="http://about.me/amalbala">About.me page</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Links to my main projects or products.</li>
<li>My CV on <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B2canXIw9OdBVk5rMjU4bFhXS3c/edit">PDF Format</a></li>
<li>CV on <a href="http://vizualize.me/">Visualize.Me</a>: This is an infography page. Clear, complete and easy to show.</li>
<li>CV on <a href="http://twicver.com/">Twicver</a>: 5 tweets to define myself (the max is 10). Other way to achieve the minimum info needed to know me.</li>
<li>Digital info on icon image: Blog, Twitter and LinkedIn.</li>
<li>Social features: I Like, favourites, etc. It generates feedback about my profile and the interest on it.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am pretty happy and satisfied with the final result and I think is a good way to manage the digital identity and personal resources, that is so important nowadays on any job searching.</p>
